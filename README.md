## Dashboard

```bash
human tui
```

<img src="human-tui.png" width="960" alt="human TUI dashboard">

The TUI shows running Claude Code instances, token usage per 5-hour window, daemon status, and connected containers — all in one view. It auto-starts the daemon if needed.

## CLI usage

Quick commands auto-detect the tracker from the key format. Use `--table` for human-readable output.

```bash
human get KAN-1                        # get an issue
human list --project=KAN               # list issues
human status KAN-1 "Done"             # set status
human jira issue start KAN-1           # transition + assign
human jira issue edit KAN-1 --title "New title"
human jira issue comment add KAN-1 "Shipped"

human pr create --head fix-login --title "Fix login" --body "Closes #42"  # open a PR; forge + repo derived from the git origin remote

human search "retry logic"             # cross-tracker search
human notion search "quarterly report" # Notion
human figma file get <file-key>        # Figma
human amplitude events list            # Amplitude
human telegram list                    # Telegram
```

## Devcontainer / Remote mode

> **Quick start:** Use the [treehouse devcontainer Feature](https://github.com/gethuman-sh/treehouse) — it installs `human`, sets up OAuth browser forwarding, and optionally configures the HTTPS proxy. Add it to your `devcontainer.json` and you're done.

AI agents running inside devcontainers need access to issue trackers, Notion, Figma, and Amplitude, but credentials should stay on the host. The daemon mode splits `human` into two roles: a **daemon** on the host (holds credentials, executes commands) and a **client** inside the container (forwards CLI args, prints results). You need `human` installed on both sides: on the host (via Homebrew, curl, etc.) to run the daemon, and inside the container (via the devcontainer Feature) as the client. It's the same binary — the mode is determined by the `HUMAN_DAEMON_ADDR` environment variable.

On the host:

```bash
human daemon start          # prints token, listens on :19285
human daemon token          # print token for copy/paste
human daemon status         # check if daemon is reachable
```

In `devcontainer.json`, add the [devcontainer Feature](https://github.com/gethuman-sh/treehouse) to install `human` and configure the daemon connection:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/gethuman-sh/treehouse/human:1": {}
  },
  "forwardPorts": [19285, 19286],
  "remoteEnv": {
    "HUMAN_DAEMON_ADDR": "host.docker.internal:19285",
    "HUMAN_DAEMON_TOKEN": "<paste from 'human daemon token'>",
    "HUMAN_CHROME_ADDR": "host.docker.internal:19286",
    "BROWSER": "human-browser"
  }
}
```

Inside the container, all commands work transparently:

```bash
human jira issues list --project=KAN       # forwarded to host daemon
human figma file get ABC123                # forwarded to host daemon
human notion search "quarterly report"     # forwarded to host daemon
```

### Chrome Bridge

When using Claude Code inside a devcontainer, the Chrome MCP bridge needs a Unix socket that Claude can discover. The `chrome-bridge` command creates this socket and tunnels traffic to the daemon on the host.

```bash
human chrome-bridge                        # daemonizes, prints PID and socket path
claude                                     # runs immediately after
```

The bridge requires `HUMAN_CHROME_ADDR` and `HUMAN_DAEMON_TOKEN` environment variables (included in the `devcontainer.json` example above). Use `--foreground` for debugging. Logs are written to `~/.human/chrome-bridge.log`.

### OAuth / browser forwarding

Tools like Claude Code require OAuth authentication, which needs to open a browser on the host. The [treehouse Feature](https://github.com/gethuman-sh/treehouse) handles this automatically by creating a `human-browser` symlink and setting `BROWSER=human-browser`. When Claude Code triggers OAuth, `human-browser` forwards the request to the daemon, which opens the real browser on the host and relays the callback back to the container.

If you're not using the treehouse Feature, add `"BROWSER": "human-browser"` to your `remoteEnv` and ensure the `human-browser` symlink exists in the container (pointing to the `human` binary).

### HTTPS proxy

The daemon includes a transparent HTTPS proxy on port 19287 that filters outbound traffic from devcontainers by domain. It reads the SNI from TLS ClientHello — no certificates needed, no traffic decryption.

Configure allowed domains in `.humanconfig.yaml`:

```yaml
proxy:
  mode: allowlist    # or "blocklist"
  domains:
    - "*.github.com"
    - "api.openai.com"
    - "registry.npmjs.org"
```

- `allowlist`: only listed domains pass, everything else blocked
- `blocklist`: only listed domains blocked, everything else passes
- No `proxy:` section: block all (safe default)

Enable in `devcontainer.json` using the [treehouse](https://github.com/gethuman-sh/treehouse) devcontainer Feature:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/gethuman-sh/treehouse/human:1": {
      "proxy": true
    }
  },
  "capAdd": ["NET_ADMIN"],
  "remoteEnv": {
    "HUMAN_DAEMON_ADDR": "host.docker.internal:19285",
    "HUMAN_DAEMON_TOKEN": "<paste from 'human daemon token'>",
    "HUMAN_CHROME_ADDR": "host.docker.internal:19286",
    "HUMAN_PROXY_ADDR": "host.docker.internal:19287",
    "BROWSER": "human-browser"
  },
  "forwardPorts": [19285, 19286],
  "postStartCommand": "sudo human-proxy-setup"
}
```

See the [treehouse README](https://github.com/gethuman-sh/treehouse#https-proxy) for full setup instructions.

## Claude Code skills

Install the Claude Code skills and agents into your project:

```bash
human install --agent claude
```

This writes skill and agent files to `.claude/` in the current directory. Re-run after upgrading `human` to pick up changes.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/human-ideate` | Challenge an idea with forcing questions and create a ready PM ticket |
| `/human-sprint` | Run the full pipeline in one command: ideate → plan → execute → review |
| `/human-ready` | Evaluates a ticket against a Definition of Ready checklist |
| `/human-brainstorm` | Explores the codebase and generates 2-3 implementation approaches |
| `/human-plan` | Fetches a ticket and produces a structured implementation plan |
| `/human-bug-plan` | Analyzes a bug ticket for root cause and writes a fix plan |
| `/human-autofix` | Autonomously triages, fixes, verifies, and opens a PR for a bug end to end — the whole trail recorded on the tracker |
| `/human-execute` | Loads a plan, executes step by step, runs a review checkpoint |
| `/human-review` | Diffs the current branch against acceptance criteria |
| `/human-findbugs` | Multi-agent pipeline to find logic errors, race conditions, and security issues |
| `/human-security` | Deep security audit with attack chain analysis and OWASP Top 10 coverage |
| `/human-gardening` | Multi-agent pipeline for codebase health analysis, refactoring triage, and automated fixes |

```bash
# Full pipeline in one command
/human-sprint "add rate limiting to the API"

# Or step by step
/human-ideate "add rate limiting"  # challenge idea, create PM ticket
/human-plan 42                     # create engineering plan
/human-execute HUM-43              # implement the plan
/human-review HUM-43               # review changes
```

All outputs are saved to `.human/` (plans, reviews, done reports, bug analyses, security audits, health reports).

### Autonomous bug fixing

`/human-autofix` runs the full bug-fix pipeline autonomously — pointed at a bug ticket, it never asks the user a question:

```bash
/human-autofix SC-86               # triage, fix, verify, and open a PR for a bug
```

It moves through six phases: triage and reproduce the bug, gate on the verdict, plan a regression-test-first fix and create a linked engineering ticket, write the failing regression test then fix the root cause and push, verify the fix is "done done", and finally open a PR and hand off.

Triage returns one of three verdicts, posted as a `[human:bug-verdict]` comment on the ticket:

- **`confirmed`** — the bug is reproduced; the pipeline proceeds to fix it.
- **`not-a-bug`** — the ticket is closed or reclassified, with no code changes.
- **`undetermined`** — the ticket is left open, with no code changes.

Only a `confirmed` bug that passes the verification gate (regression test fails before the fix, passes after, and the full suite is green) gets a PR. The fix lands on an `autofix/<eng-key>` branch with commits referencing both the PM and engineering keys, then `human pr create` opens the PR (forge and repo derived from the git origin remote). A `[human:ready-for-review]` handoff comment is posted on the PM ticket carrying the `engineering:`, `branch:`, `commits:`, and `pr:` lines, and the TUI's `(R)` marker links straight to the PR.

The whole trail lives on the trackers — bug comment, engineering ticket, and PR — so no `.human/` working files are produced. If the build or tests aren't green, or `human pr create` fails, the pipeline stops and reports honestly rather than claiming success.

## Configuration

The fastest way to get started:

```bash
human init
```

The interactive wizard lets you pick trackers and tools, then writes `.humanconfig.yaml` and prints the environment variables to set.

Alternatively, configure manually:

```yaml
# Issue trackers
jiras:
  - name: work
    url: https://work.atlassian.net
    user: me@work.com
    key: your-api-token

githubs:
  - name: oss
    token: ghp_abc123

linears:
  - name: work
    projects:
      - ENG

# Tools
notions:
  - name: work
    token: ntn_abc123

figmas:
  - name: design
    token: figd_abc123

amplitudes:
  - name: product
    url: https://analytics.eu.amplitude.com

# Messaging
telegrams:
  - name: bot
    allowed_users:
      - 12345678

# Outbound proxy
proxy:
  mode: allowlist
  domains:
    - "*.github.com"
```

Tokens can also be set via environment variables using the pattern `<TRACKER>_<NAME>_TOKEN` (e.g. `JIRA_WORK_KEY`, `NOTION_WORK_TOKEN`, `FIGMA_DESIGN_TOKEN`, `AMPLITUDE_PRODUCT_KEY` + `AMPLITUDE_PRODUCT_SECRET`).

See [documentation.md](docs/documentation.md) for full configuration details.

## Build

```bash
make build
```
